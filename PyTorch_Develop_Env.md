# PyTorch Development Environment Setup

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will go through the steps to set up a PyTorch development environment on Windows. We will be using Anaconda as our Python distribution and Visual Studio Code as our text editor.

## Step 1: Install Anaconda

Download and install the latest version of Anaconda from the official website: https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows

## Step 2: Create a new environment

Open Anaconda Prompt (Anaconda3) and create a new environment by running the following command:

```
conda create -n pytorch python=3.6
```

This will create a new environment named "pytorch" with Python 3.6.

## Step 3: Activate the environment

Activate the newly created environment by running the following command:

```
activate pytorch
```

## Step 4: Install PyTorch

Install PyTorch by running the following command:

```
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
```

This will install the latest version of PyTorch and its dependencies.

## Step 5: Install Visual Studio Code

Download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website: https://code.visualstudio.com/

## Step 6: Set up Visual Studio Code

Open Visual Studio Code and install the following extensions:

- Python
- PyTorch

## Step 7: Create a new Python file

Create a new Python file by clicking on the "New File" button on the left-hand side of the screen. Name the file "test.py" and save it in your project directory.

## Step 8: Write some code

Write some code in the "test.py" file. For example:

```
import torch

x = torch.rand(5, 3)
print(x)
```

## Step 9: Run the code

Run the code by clicking on the "Run" button on the top-right corner of the screen or by pressing F5. The output should be a random tensor of size (5, 3).
## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we went through the steps to set up a PyTorch development environment on Windows. We used Anaconda as our Python distribution and Visual Studio Code as our text editor. We created a new environment, installed PyTorch, and wrote some code to test our installation.
By following these steps, you should be able to start developing PyTorch models on Windows.
